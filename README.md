# Undercooked

# Summary

This game is a study case for the game Overcooked! 2.

All art assets like Textures, models, audio clips etc where created by the indie game maker Code Monkey for this Free Complete Unity Course.

However, the game structure and the source-code were created by me and they are very different from the course.

This project uses many Unity Packages created and published by me. All of them are on the MIT license so you can freely use them into your project
